In Option, I had the privilege of conducting a presentation on the Internet of Things (IoT), covering the topic from basic concepts to the creation of a fully functional IoT system. During the session, we explored key topics such as embedded systems, web protocols, and the implementation of IoT in cloud environments.

I invite you to watch the video below to relive this enriching experience at the Option Academy.
