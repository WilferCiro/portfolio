#### Codelco:

I designed and developed a data ingestion forms platform using React and Nest.js. This allowed stakeholders to input and manage large amounts of information efficiently and accurately. Additionally, I implemented integration with Azure DevOps services to ensure code quality and software delivery continuity. I created automated tests to guarantee code quality and system stability.

#### Kitchen Center:

I performed regular maintenance and updates on the sales and back office system using React, Nest.js, and Shopify GraphQL. This enhanced the system's functionality and efficiency while significantly reducing downtime. I implemented new features and functionalities, collaborating with other developers and the technical support team to identify and resolve issues promptly. I carefully documented the maintenance and update process for the sales system, resulting in improved internal process efficiency, reduced system downtime, and enhanced technical support.
