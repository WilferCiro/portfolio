I taught Python, React, and Java to students of all ages and skill levels. I was responsible for preparing and delivering educational materials, such as practical exercises and projects, so that they could apply what they learned. Additionally, I assessed their progress and provided feedback and guidance for continuous improvement. I also offered guidance on the SCRUM framework to all students.
