I designed and developed an administrative platform using technologies such as React, Next.js, Express, and Nest.js. Creating this platform enabled more efficient and automated data management, along with reduced processing time for clients. I built a RESTful API that facilitated seamless and reliable communication between the front-end and back-end. To enhance performance, I implemented dynamic data loading techniques using Next.js. Additionally, I crafted an intuitive and user-friendly interface to enhance user productivity and reduce learning curve. I integrated multiple third-party systems, such as payment and email systems, to further automate data management processes. Finally, I conducted unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the platform's quality and reliability, resulting in a significant reduction in errors and system failures.
