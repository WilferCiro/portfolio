Throughout my life, I have loved software development. I started at the age of 15, creating various platforms for the school I attended. I even built a complete system to manage all academic and disciplinary data for students, in addition to handling the institution's inventory.

In college, I had the opportunity to work as an assistant for the thesis committee, where my main responsibility was developing a platform to manage all thesis projects. This platform allowed for tracking the preliminary project and the final report, as well as enabling the evaluation of the work.

I have been involved in IoT projects, programming embedded systems, data servers, and desktop applications on a Raspberry Pi.

Recently, I decided to undertake several backend projects using different languages, frameworks, and DDD architectures. This was done in order to establish a solid foundation for starting new projects.
